# vSphere REST API Sample Web Application
*Originally presented at VMworld 2017 in session SER1912BU VMware Open-Source SDKs: From Getting Started to Web App in One Hour*

Basic [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web application illustrating connecting to the vSphere REST API endpoint using JavaScript.

**NOTE:** This app is for **demonstration purposes only** and should NOT be used against your production vSphere environment until/unless you have thoroughly reviewed/modified the code specifically for your environment.

## Install and run the web app
From the vSphere Automation SDK for REST folder do the following:

    $ cd samples/webapp
    $ npm install

### Edit Configuration File
If you are not using Wiremock (see below) you will need to edit the file ./samples/webapp/.env and set your HOST, USERID and PASS vars to point to your vSphere **staging** host.

    USERID=administrator@vsphere.local
    PASS=VMware1!
    LOGIN_PATH=/rest/com/vmware/cis/session
    TITLE=vSphere REST Demo
    HOST=<url to your vcenter host>

### Setup mock infrastructure
Included with this repo are a set of Wiremock files allowing you to mock the vSphere REST API and run the sample. You'll need to [download wiremock](http://wiremock.org/) and run it as follows:

    java -jar wiremock-standalone-2.5.0.jar --https-port=8082 --verbose --root-dir <path-to-repo-wiremock-folder>

Example:

    java -jar ~/Downloads/wiremock/wiremock-standalone-2.5.0.jar --https-port=8082 --verbose --root-dir ~/github/vapi-express/wiremock

### Run the server
Start the Express web app:

   $ npm start

Finally, browse to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the login page.

## How it works
This simple two-page web application illustrates how to authenticate to the vSphere REST API endpoint and make subsequent calls to the API to return information from a vCenter server instance. The home page is a login page and upon successful authentication displays an inventory (/inventory) page which renders the results of an vSphere REST API call. By default the application displays a list of the hosts from the [/rest/vcenter/host](https://code.vmware.com/apis/191/vsphere-automation#/doc/operations/com/vmware/vcenter/host.list-operation.html) API. The inventory page also accepts a "path" query parameter to call other API's (ex. /?path=/rest/vcenter/datastore). The application as written only supports HTTP GET calls to the REST API meaning it's read-only.

## Requirements
npm packages used in this example:

    "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.13.4",
        "clarity-ui": "^0.10.0",
        "pug": "^2.0.0-rc.3",
        "request": "^2.72.0",
        "body-parser": "^1.15.1",
        "dotenv": "^2.0.0"
    },

## Using Clarity CSS
The app includes a base template to render the site using the CSS from [VMware's Clarity Design System](https://clarity.design) however is not a full clarity-seed application and does not require Angular.
